  <h1>Ananya’s Rise from Darkness</h1>
  <p>

Ananya was once the kind of girl everyone admired.
Bright eyes, endless laughter, and dreams bigger than the sky.
She wanted to be a teacher, to spread knowledge, to shape futures.

But life, as it often does, tested her in ways she never imagined.
In her second year of college, she failed in two subjects.
It wasn’t a disaster for most, but for her, it felt like the end.

“Maybe you’re not good enough,” whispered her own mind.
Those words became chains, wrapping around her thoughts.
Slowly, she stopped attending classes.
Her laughter faded, replaced by silence.

Friends noticed, but she kept saying, “I’m fine.”
Her parents worried, but she closed her door and cried alone.
Days turned into weeks, and she stopped even looking into the mirror.
The girl who once dreamed of teaching others could not even encourage herself.

One evening, while scrolling aimlessly through her phone,
she stumbled upon a video where a woman spoke of surviving depression.
For the first time, Ananya saw her own pain reflected in someone else’s story.
A tiny spark lit up inside her.

She thought: If she could fight back, maybe I can too.

The next day, Ananya did something brave.
She wrote a simple message to a helpline:
“I don’t feel okay. I need help.”

It was the first step — small, but powerful.
Therapy sessions began.
At first, she felt awkward, even ashamed.
But slowly, she learned that mental health was just like physical health.
If you can heal a broken bone, you can also heal a broken heart.

She began keeping a diary.
Each page carried her struggles, but also her little victories.
“Today, I smiled.”
“Today, I attended one class.”
“Today, I helped a friend.”

Line by line, day by day, she rewrote her story.
Her family, once helpless, now became her pillars of support.
Her friends, once distant, now walked beside her without judgment.

A year later, she stood on stage at her college seminar.
Her topic? “Mental Health Awareness for Students.”
As she spoke, her voice trembled — not from fear, but from pride.

The same girl who once thought she was weak
was now guiding hundreds of students on how to fight darkness.

Ananya’s journey was not about becoming perfect.
It was about realizing that strength is not the absence of pain,
but the courage to walk through it and keep going.

Today, she runs a small support group in her community.
She is known not as “the girl who failed” but as “the girl who fought.”

Her story teaches us one truth:
Darkness may visit, but it can never defeat the human spirit that chooses to rise.</p>
