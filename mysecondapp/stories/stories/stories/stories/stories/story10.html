  <h1>Raghav and the Locked Room</h1>
 
  <p>
  Raghav was a 25-year-old engineering student from Hyderabad, known for his sharp mind and quick decisions.
One evening, while returning from his college library, he was followed by two strangers.
At first, he ignored them, thinking it was just coincidence.
But as he turned into a narrow lane, he realized they were deliberately shadowing him.

Before he could react, the men blocked his path and pushed him inside an abandoned building.
The doors slammed shut.
His phone was snatched away, and he was locked inside a dusty, dark room.
His heart raced — he was trapped.

Fear tried to take over, but Raghav remembered something his teacher once told him:
“In a crisis, don’t panic. Think faster than your fear.”

He scanned the room quickly.
There was a broken chair, some glass pieces, and an old window partially jammed with wooden planks.
The kidnappers outside were whispering, planning what to do with him.

Instead of shouting or begging, Raghav stayed quiet — listening.
He realized the kidnappers assumed he was weak, panicked, and helpless.
That assumption would be his strength.

Raghav took the chair and quietly broke one of the planks near the window.
But he didn’t climb out immediately.
Instead, he picked up a glass shard and kept it hidden in his sleeve.
Then, using a trick, he banged the chair loudly as if he was trying to escape desperately.
This made the kidnappers rush in.

The moment one man entered, Raghav used the glass shard as a bluff weapon, pressing it against the man’s arm.
He didn’t stab — just enough to scare.
Startled, the man screamed, and in that confusion, Raghav shoved him toward the second kidnapper.

Both stumbled.
That gave him exactly three seconds.
He sprinted, using the half-broken window to slip outside.
His arms got scratched, but he didn’t stop.
He ran straight to a nearby tea stall where people were sitting.

Panting, bleeding slightly, he told them everything.
The crowd gathered quickly, and the kidnappers fled before they could be caught.
Raghav immediately went to the police and filed a report.

Later, when asked how he managed to stay calm, he said:
“I didn’t stay calm. I was terrified. But instead of feeding fear, I fed my mind with possibilities.”

That night, Raghav became a local hero — not because he was stronger than his attackers,
but because he was smarter.

His story became a reminder to everyone:
Weapons aren’t always the answer.
Sometimes, intelligence, observation, and timing are the sharpest shields we carry.
